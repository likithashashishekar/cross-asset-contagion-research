# CROSS-ASSET MOMENTUM CONTAGION RESEARCH

## Executive Summary
This research analyzes contagion pathways across 7 major asset classes using 499 trading days of high-frequency data. 
We identify dynamic correlation regimes and shock propagation patterns for improved risk management.

## Key Quantitative Findings

### 1. Structural Relationships
- **Equity-Volatility**: SPX-VIX correlation: -0.795 (strong inverse)
- **Tech-Broad Market**: SPX-NDX correlation: 0.962 (near-perfect comovement)
- **Flight-to-Safety**: SPX-TLT correlation: 0.080 (moderate hedge)

### 2. Contagion Pathways Identified
**Primary Shock Transmission Channels:**
1. **Equity Shock** -> Volatility Spike -> Global Risk-Off
2. **Dollar Strength** -> Commodity Weakness -> Inflation Expectations
3. **Oil Price Shock** -> Growth Concerns -> Equity Outflows

### 3. Regime-Dependent Behavior
- Correlations are **non-stationary** and change with market volatility
- **Crisis periods** show intensified relationships (correlation breakdown)
- **Normal periods** exhibit stable, predictable patterns

## Methodology

### Data & Timeframe
- **Assets**: SPX, NDX, VIX, TLT, DXY, CL1, GC1
- **Period**: 2023-11-06 to 2025-11-03
- **Frequency**: Daily returns, rolling 30-day windows

### Analytical Framework
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Static and dynamic relationships
2. **Rolling Windows**: Time-varying dependency structures  
3. **Regime Analysis**: Crisis vs normal market behavior
4. **Shock Propagation**: Impact simulation across assets

## Trading & Risk Applications

### Portfolio Construction
- **Optimal Hedging**: VIX most effective during equity stress
- **Diversification**: Gold provides non-correlated returns
- **Position Sizing**: Adjust based on correlation regimes

### Risk Management
- **Multi-asset stress testing**
- **Cross-desk exposure monitoring** 
- **Early warning indicators for regime changes**

### Quantitative Strategies
- **Pairs trading** based on correlation mean-reversion
- **Volatility targeting** using VIX relationships
- **Cross-asset momentum** strategies

## Business Impact

For trading firms like Jane Street, this research enables:
- **Better capital allocation** across asset classes
- **Improved risk-adjusted returns** through dynamic hedging
- **Enhanced crisis preparedness** with contagion mapping
- **Quantitative framework** for multi-asset decision making

## Conclusion

Cross-asset contagion is a critical factor in modern financial markets. 
Understanding these dynamic relationships provides competitive advantages in:

1. **Risk Management** - Anticipating shock propagation
2. **Portfolio Construction** - Optimal asset allocation
3. **Trading Strategies** - Exploiting regime-dependent patterns
4. **Crisis Response** - Rapid adaptation to market stress
